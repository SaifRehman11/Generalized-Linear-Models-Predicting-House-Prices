# Generalized-Linear-Models-Predicting-House-Prices
This is one of my classwork assignments for my generalized linear models class. The main objectives of this model is to use generalized linear models to create a model that will predict house prices. The main methods employed in this basic analysis is to perform residual analysis, ANOVA tests, backwards and forwards elimination, feature selection and engineering, outlier analysis, and performing box-cox analysis. My model and report received the highest grades in the class.
